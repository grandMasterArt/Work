Description:

I am currently an Inter at an organization HighRadius Technology. Learning my way into a cybersecurity career. I am an RED Team Enthusiast. Currently going through a learning process where solving different kinds of rooms at a platform named "Try Hack Me '',to make me understand all the stages of performing a Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessments.

This Repository represents my current on going practice assessments and to hone the mindset of an Hacker.My current experiences are in the Try Hack Me platform & CTF-learn and currently looking for live CTF’s and Bug Bounty to gain some experience. All my work will be updated as due course of time.
This repository contains CTF's solutions and my own ReadMe notes. It’s exactly how I think while solving any critical room which has Windows or Linux Based Operating Systems. Though it contains only a few Mis-Configuration issue related rooms like Jenkins, Internal but also few Programming, Forensic, Web, Reverse Engineering topic related ctf’s which groomed me as an all rounded penetration tester.
I will be updating my repository with some more rooms of Try Hack Me which will be related to the Buffer Overflow Type of attacks and a possibility of Live CTF, Please stay tuned.

I am also preparing for my OSCP certification but I still believe I need some more experience in Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessments for the certification as a validation of my work. 

Thank you for giving a look at my piece of art in the field of CyberSecurity. I am also looking actively for any work in the field of Information Security.
