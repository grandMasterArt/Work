Description:

I am currently an Intern at an organization HighRadius Technology. Working as an Intern in the AUTO UI Team. currently learning a new skill set to turn my career into the field of cybersecurity. I am an RED Team Enthusiast. Currently working through different types of Try Hack Me mis-configuration room where I try solving different kinds of rooms to make me understand all the stages of performing a Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessments. Kali Linux is my top preference for performing penetration testing.

This Repository represents my current on going practice assessments and to hone the mindset of an Attacker. My current experiences are in the Try Hack Me platform & CTF-learn, actively looking for live CTF’s and Bug Bounty to gain some more experience. All of my work will be updated as the due course of time.

This repository contains CTF's solutions and my own ReadMe notes. It’s exactly how I think while solving any critical room which has Windows or Linux Based Operating Systems. Though it contains only a few Mis-Configuration issue related rooms like Jenkins, Internal but also few Programming, Forensic, Web, Reverse Engineering topic related ctf’s which groomed me as an all rounded penetration tester.

I will be updating my repository with some more rooms of "Try Hack Me" which will be related to the Buffer Overflow Type of attacks and a possibility of Live CTF in this month of January, 2021.

I am also preparing for my OSCP certification but I still believe I need some more experience in Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessments for the certification as a validation of my work. 

Thank you for giving a look at my piece of art in the field of CyberSecurity. I am also looking actively for any offer in the field of Information Security.

Pranay Chatterjee
